In this project, we are creating a few very simple trivial websites with different tools following the Chainlink Bootcamp.

1.  the most basic html and javascript website we can make with ethers.
    We connect with a metamask account by asking doing a request with the window.ethereum object that was already inserted by metamask. Now metamast is connected and we can send transaction through our frontend. Using browserify so we can use require ethers in the frontend.
