project1-crowdsourcing-contracts-remix:
This is a remix ethereum project made in Remix, it contains fundable smart contracts, a crowdsourcing application is made that can be funded by anybody and the funds can only be withdrawn by the owner of the contract. 
By integrating chainlink price feeds, a minumum deposit amount in USD is integrated by creating conversion functions.

project2-crowdsourcing-contracts-web3-brownie:
Almost the same as the previous project, but this time it is not using the online remix IDE, but vscode in my local environment.
