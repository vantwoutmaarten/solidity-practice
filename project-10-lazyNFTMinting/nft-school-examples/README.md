NFT School is just getting started, so check back for more examples soon!

### End-to-end experience

Check out [end-to-end](./end-to-end) for an example of minting NFTs from a web browser, using [nft.storage](https://nft.storage) to store NFT data on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io).

See the guide at https://nftschool.dev/tutorial/end-to-end-experience/

### Lazy Minting

The [lazy-minting](./lazy-minting/) directory contains an example of minting NFTs at the time of first sale. This works by redeeming a signed "voucher" issued by the NFT creator.
