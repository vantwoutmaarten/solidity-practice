Practicing solidity by building simple Dapps till full stack Defi

project1-crowdsourcing-contracts-remix:

This is a remix ethereum project made in Remix, it contains fundable smart contracts, a crowdsourcing application is made that can be funded by anybody and the funds can only be withdrawn by the owner of the contract. 
By integrating chainlink price feeds, a minumum deposit amount in USD is integrated by creating conversion functions.

project2-crowdsourcing-contracts-web3-brownie:

Almost the same as the previous project in terms of contracts, but this time it is not using the online remix IDE, 
here in this project, I deployed contracts to local ganache blockchains, deploying to testnets and even mainnets, signing and sending transactions to these nets.
Also practiced with private key management and the ganache-cli.
